## What comes to mind when you think of Geoscripting?

Answer on Wooclap in the link in the chat!

## Did you know?!

Scripting can be used to process satellite data easily to monitor deforestation globally

- Google Earth Engine for global deforestation monitoring
      - https://earthengine.google.org/#intro

## Why geoscripting?

![](figs/solve-cool-problems.png)

## Why geoscripting?

- Reproducible: you keep track of what you have done 
- Efficient: you can write a script to do something and repeat your analysis x1000... 
  - Good for finding errors

Can you think of other advantages?

## Why geoscripting?

-  Enable collaboration
    - a huge social R and Python community

## Why geoscripting?

- Build your own tools and functions (e.g. automated web-processing, etc.)

## What is a scripting (interpreted) language?

## What  is a scripting language?

- A scripting language can interpret and automate the execution of tasks, instead of clicking!!!
- A scripting language is the glue, between different commands, functions, and objectives without the need to compile it for each OS (e.g. windows)
- This is different from a compiled language like C/C++/Fortran 
    - these are languages that need to compile the whole program/app first.

## Compiling

Passing the source code through a compiler, which translates the `high-level language` instructions into an `exe`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.width=6, strip.white=TRUE}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("figs/traditionalCompiler.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

## The main scripting languages for GIS and Remote sensing currently are: 

- R
- Python
- Julia
- GRASS (functions are also included in QGIS)
- JavaScript (geoweb scripting)
- Matlab
- IDL (ENVI)
- ...

## Python versus R

- Python is a general purpose programming language, stronger in deep learning
- R is easier to use and is particularly strong in statistical computing and visualisation
- Syntactic differences between R and Python can be confusing
- There are many R and Python packages for spatial analyses

![](figs/RPythonS.png)

## R packages
![](figs/worldcloudRpackage.png)

## Many programs have support for Python & R

e.g.:
 
 - QGIS
 - GRASS
 - PostGIS

## ...Cliffhanger!

How will you learn about all that in the course? Find out after this 5-minute break!

## The Geoscripting course

Goal:

- Scripting to solve spatial challenges!
- **Learn by doing**
- **Learn how to keep on learning**


A team of `R` & `Python` experts who use geo-scripting languages 
every day helped to develop this course

## Who are we?

- Course coordinator: Dainius Masiliūnas
- Lecturer: Arno Timmer
- Teaching assistants: Elina Kreuzberg, Zoi Gutschke, Jacotte Monroe, Yelle Vosteen, Friedrich Röseler
- Guest lecturers: Robert Masolele, Nandika Tsendbazar, Sietse van der Woude, Laura Cue la Rosa

## Geoscripting learning objectives

- Demonstrate scripting skills by writing clear, documented, and reproducible scripts to read, write and visualise spatial data 
- Apply version control supporting effective collaboration in a team 
- Use documentation, search tools, and contribute to discussion platforms with reproducible examples as an aid to solve scripting challenges effectively 
- Be willing to use and create open-source software with an appropriate software license 
- Combine functions from novel libraries to efficiently process spatial data 
- Create an integrated software project that solves a spatial challenge 

## Course concept

Flipped Classroom concept:

![](figs/flipping-the-classroom.jpg)

* Experts from companies, research institutes and 
university will present (guest presentations)

## How will we learn all that?

![](figs/big-picture.svg){width=70%}
<!-- Uncomment below for PDF, above for HTML
![](figs/big-picture_svg-tex.pdf)-->

## What we will do every two days

* Monday & Wednesday (Mondays shifted 1.5 hours later):
  * 14:00 – 14:45: 	Guest presentation and/or plenary discussion session about tutorial and exercise 
  * 14:45 – 15:30:	Review of exercise from day before: feedback from the teachers, best solutions, and common mistakes; introduction to the tutorial of today 
  * 15:30 – 17:10: 	Follow tutorial and answer questions (individually, self-study); finish peer review of exercise or assignment from the previous day 
* Tuesday & Thursday:
  * 14:00 – 17:00: 	Work on exercise (in pairs, teaching assistants available), submission via CodeGrade in Brightspace
* Friday: assignments/project preparation work/exam

## Deliverables

* Practice exercises: in pairs, not graded, but peer reviewed; assignments and exam are very similar, so good practice!
* Graded assignments: in pairs, graded (**20%**) and peer reviewed; peer review is graded too!
* Exam: individual assignment, graded (**30%**), **not** peer reviewed but receive feedback from autotests, mostly practice.
* Final project: in groups of four, graded (**50%**) and peer reviewed.
  * Choose a geoscripting topic feasible within 7 half-days

Starter material will be made available for each group/person on GitLab: [https://git.wur.nl/geoscripting-2023-september](https://git.wur.nl/geoscripting-2023-september).
Every change in the starter is automatically submitted to Brightspace (CodeGrade), rubrics and automatic feedback is available there.

## Team work & helping each other

- Log into GitLab and set up 2-factor authentication: [https://git.wur.nl/-/profile/account](https://git.wur.nl/-/profile/account)
- Set up teams of two:
  - Create or join a group on Brightspace > Deliverables > Practice exercises > Exercise 1
  - For project work, you will work in groups of 4, which we will set based on your chosen topics

## Heeelp!

Confused?! Always start in Microsoft Teams!

- Announcements in the General channel!
- If you like, you can create a new channel for your team's internal communication
- Tabs at the top link to all content!
- Support in the Support channel! Or raising your hand/using a sticker in class.
- Offline support on the Brightspace discussion forum!

## What we will do next

* Today (Aurora):
  * 15:40 - 17:20: this presentation
  * 17:20 - 18:50: Self-study ([geoscripting-wur.github.io](https://geoscripting-wur.github.io))
* Tomorrow (Aurora):
  * 14:00 - **17:00**: Use git to submit your thoughts on what you would like to work on during the course
  * 16:00 - 16:30: Demo on how to use CodeGrade
* Wednesday (Orion B4007):
  * 14:00 - 14:45: Discussion about the first exercise
  * 15:00 - 15:30: Presentation about Git
  * Rest of the day: self-study Bash tutorial, finish peer review  of the previous exercise by the end of the day

Deadlines are always **hard**!

## Peer review

- When you do peer review, check the exercise of the day on Brightspace.
- You get access to the solution of the teams you are supposed to review.
- Review according to the rubric on Brightspace (CodeGrade) and the exercise/assignment description.
  - You can use in-line comments and general comments.
  - Don't review the review.
  - In upcoming exercises, reproducibility is a prerequisite!

## Summary

* Geoscripting is an essential skill in research, as well as highly sought-after in the industry
* Scripting saves you time in the long run
* Geoscripting is an intensive, whole-day course where you learn best by doing
* Deliverables are all practice, little theory!
* Mind the deadlines, and don't forget to review others!

## Learning outcomes of the rest of today and tomorrow:

- Getting started with Linux, Git
- Submit an exercise to CodeGrade!
- Think of the project topic

## Questions?

<!--- What is a "reproducible script"?
