## What comes to mind when you think of Geoscripting?

Answer on Wooclap in the link in the chat!

## Did you know?!

Scripting can be used to process satellite data easily to monitor deforestation globally

- Google Earth Engine for global deforestation monitoring
      - https://earthengine.google.org/#intro

## Why geoscripting?

![](figs/solve-cool-problems.png)

## Why geoscripting?

- Reproducible: you keep track of what you have done 
- Efficient: you can write a script to do something and repeat your analysis x1000... 
  - Good for finding errors

Can you think of other advantages?

## Why geoscripting?

-  Enable collaboration
    - a huge social R and Python community

## Why geoscripting?

- Build your own tools and functions (e.g. automated web-processing, etc.)

## What is a scripting (interpreted) language?

## What  is a scripting language?

- A scripting language can interpret and automate the execution of tasks, instead of clicking!!!
- A scripting language is the glue, between different commands, functions, and objectives without the need to compile it for each OS (e.g. windows)
- This is different from a compiled language like C/C++/Fortran 
    - these are languages that need to compile the whole program/app first.

## Compiling

Passing the source code through a compiler, which translates the `high-level language` instructions into an `exe`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.width=6, strip.white=TRUE}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("figs/traditionalCompiler.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

## The main scripting languages for GIS and Remote sensing currently are: 

- R
- Python
- Julia
- GRASS (functions are also included in QGIS)
- JavaScript (geoweb scripting)
- Matlab
- IDL (ENVI)
- ...

## Python versus R

- Python is a general purpose programming language, stronger in deep learning
- R is easier to use and is particularly strong in statistical computing and visualisation
- Syntactic differences between R and Python can be confusing
- There are many R and Python packages for spatial analyses

![](figs/RPythonS.png)

## R packages
![](figs/worldcloudRpackage.png)

## Many programs have support for Python & R

e.g.:
 
 - QGIS
 - GRASS
 - PostGIS

## The Geoscripting course

Goal:

- Scripting to solve spatial challenges!
- **Learn by doing**
- **Learn how to keep on learning**


A team of `R` & `Python` experts who use geo-scripting languages 
every day helped to develop this course

## Who are we?

- Course coordinator: Dainius Masiliūnas
- Lecturer: Arno Timmer
- Teaching assistants (PhD): Tijmen Remijnse, Xuemeng Tian, Yang Li
- Teaching assistants (MSc): Wybren de Jong, Janiek Hooijman, Ella van Loenen 
- Guest lecturers: See course guide

## Geoscripting learning objectives

- Demonstrate scripting skills by writing clear, documented, and reproducible scripts to read, write and visualise spatial data 
- Apply version control supporting effective collaboration in a team 
- Use documentation, (search) tools, and contribute to discussion platforms with reproducible examples as an aid to solve scripting challenges effectively 
- Be willing to use and create open-source software with an appropriate software license 
- Combine functions from novel libraries to efficiently process spatial data 
- Create an integrated software project that solves a spatial challenge 

## Course concept

Flipped Classroom concept:

![](figs/flipping-the-classroom.jpg)

* Experts from companies, research institutes and 
university will present (guest presentations)

## How will we learn all that?

![](figs/big-picture.svg){width=70%}
<!-- Uncomment below for PDF, above for HTML
![](figs/big-picture_svg-tex.pdf)-->

## Deliverables

* Practice exercises: in pairs, not graded, but peer reviewed; assignments and exam are very similar, so good practice!
* Graded assignments: in pairs, graded (**20%**) and peer reviewed; peer review is graded too!
* Exam: individual assignment, graded (**30%**), **not** peer reviewed but receive feedback from autotests, mostly practice.
* Final project: in groups of four, graded (**50%**) and peer reviewed.
  * Choose a geoscripting topic feasible within 7 half-days

## Exercises

* Starter material will be made available for each group/person on GitLab: [https://git.wur.nl/geoscripting-2025](https://git.wur.nl/geoscripting-2025).
* Every change in your starter is automatically submitted to Brightspace (CodeGrade), rubrics and automatic feedback is available there.

## AI Traffic Light {.columns-2}

<p class="forceBreak"></p>

Green – Extensive Use

* Students can use generative AI throughout their work, as long as they disclose usage and critically reflect on its contribution.
* WUR resources on Generative AI: ![](figs/genai-qr.png)

## Peer review

- When you do peer review, check the exercise of the day on Brightspace.
- You get access to the solution of the teams you are supposed to review.
- Review according to the rubric on Brightspace (CodeGrade) and the exercise/assignment description.
  - You can use in-line comments and general comments.
  - Don't review the review.
  - In upcoming exercises, reproducibility is a prerequisite!

## Team work & helping each other

- Log into GitLab: [https://git.wur.nl/-/profile/account](https://git.wur.nl/-/profile/account)
- Set up teams of two:
  - Check your group on Brightspace (https://brightspace.wur.nl) > Deliverables > Practice exercises > Exercise 1!
  - If you don't have a team member, join an existing group with one person, if none, create a new group and join it
  - For project work, you will work in groups of 4, which we will set based on your chosen topics

## Heeelp!

Confused?! Always start in Microsoft Teams!

- Find your teammate! You can use Microsoft Teams (https://teams.microsoft.com) to write them a message
- Announcements in the Announcements channel!
- If you like, you can create a new channel for your team's internal communication
- Tabs at the top link to all content!
- Support in the Support channel! Or raising your hand in class.
- Offline support on the Brightspace discussion forum!
