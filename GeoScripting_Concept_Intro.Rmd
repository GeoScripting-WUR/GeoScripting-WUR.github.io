## Did you know?!

Scripting can be used to process satellite data easily to monitor deforestation globally

- Google Earth Engine for global deforestation monitoring
      - https://earthengine.google.org/#intro

## Why geo-scripting?

![](figs/solve-cool-problems.png)

## Why geo-scripting?

- Reproducible: you keep track of what you have done 

- Efficient: you can write a script to do something and repeat your analysis x1000... 

-	Good for finding errors

Can you think of other advantages?

## Why geo-scripting?

-  Enable collaboration
    - a huge social R and Python community

## Why geo-scripting?

- Build your own tools and functions (e.g. automated web-processing, etc.)

[See demo's!](https://geoscripting-wur.github.io/Scripting4Geo/#why-scripting)

## Geo-scripting learning objectives

- Read, write, and visualize spatial data using a script
- Find and use  functions for geo-data handling
- Know how to find help
    - Write a clear and reproducible script
    - Learn how to help each other
- Apply learned concepts for your own geo-challenge

## The geo-scripting course

Goal:

- Scripting to solve spatial challenges!
- **Learn by doing**
- **Learn how to keep on learning**


A team of `R` & `Python` experts who use geo-scripting languages 
every day helped to develop this course

## Course concept

Flipped Classroom concept:

![](figs/flipping-the-classroom.jpg)

* Experts from companies, research institutes and 
university will present (guest lectures)

## Course concept

See Brightspace:

- Daily planning
- Scoring
- Submission of exercises and assignments

## Team work & helping each other

See Microsoft teams!

- Teams of two:
- select the team and fill in the form (Git repository)
- Other teams can be selected for the project work

<div class="centered">

</div>


## Learning outcomes of today:

- Getting started with Linux, Git, Refresh R scripting skills
- Able to write a function
- Submit an exercise that will be automatically evaluated!
    
## What  is a scripting language?

- A scripting language can interpret and automate the execution of tasks, instead of clicking!!!
- A scripting language is the glue, between different commands, functions, and objectives without the need to compile it for each OS (e.g. windows)
- This is different from like C/C++/Fortran 
    - these are languages that need to be compiled first.

## Compiling

Passing the source code through a compiler, which translates the `high-level language` instructions into an `exe`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.width=6, strip.white=TRUE}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("figs/traditionalCompiler.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

## The main scripting languages for GIS and Remote sensing currently are: 

- R
- Python
- GRASS (grass function are included in QGIS)
- JavaScript for geoweb scripting
- Matlab
- IDL (ENVI)
- ...

## Python versus R

- Python is a general purpose programming language
- R is particularly strong in statistical computing and graphics
- Syntactic differences between R and Python can be confusing  
- There are many R and Python packages for spatial analyses

## R packages
![](figs/worldcloudRpackage.png)

## Many programs have support for

 Python & R e.g.:
 
 - QGIS
 - GRASS
 - PostGIS

## Time for R action!

- Linux
- Git
- What is a "reproducible script"?

## Reproducibility
