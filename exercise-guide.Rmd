# Exercise guide

Each morning tutorial is followed by an exercise in the afternoon. These daily exercises are made available each day on the [geoscripting-innovation organization](https://github.com/geoscripting-innovation). This manual shows you how to obtain the repository, how to work on the exercise together with your teammate and how to submit and review other exercises.

## 1. Fork
First you need to *fork* the exercise repository. For an explanation of forking, see the [tutorial of lesson 1](http://geoscripting-wur.github.io/RProjectManagement/). 

- Go to the [geoscripting-innovation organization](https://github.com/geoscripting-innovation), and make sure your Github account is signed in and added to the organization

- Look for the repository named 'Exercise#-starter', where # is the lesson number of the day

- Open the repository by clicking on the name. Then, fork the repository by clicking on the *fork* button at the right-top of your screen

## 2. Add teammate and clone

Now you have your own version of the exercise repository, which you can clone to do the exercise on your computer. First you need to add your team member as collaborator to the repository.  

- Go to settings, and click on *collaborators* in the menu on the left

- Add your team member by filling out their Github account name

- Clone the exercise (check the [tutorial of lesson 1](http://geoscripting-wur.github.io/RProjectManagement/))

- Work on the exercise and use Travis CI for feedback (check the Travis CI introduction)

## 3. Submit and review

Before the deadline, you submit your solution of the exercise via a *pull request*. Your exercise, and all exercises of the other teams, are then visible in the original repository on the [geoscripting-innovation organization](https://github.com/geoscripting-innovation) under *pull requests*. Here you can review other teams.

- Push your final commits to your exercise repository

- Go to your repository on Github and click on *new pull request* 

![pull request](https://github.com/PTOoster/Exercise-Guide/blob/master/images/pull_button.png?raw=true)

- Click on the button *create pull request*

- As subject of the pull request, write your team name, and click on the button *create pull request*

![Add team member](https://github.com/PTOoster/Exercise-Guide/blob/master/images/pull_request.png?raw=true)

- Go to the [geoscripting-innovation organization](https://github.com/geoscripting-innovation). Under the tab *pull requests* you can now see the exercise repositories of all teams. To review, leave a comment under the pull request
